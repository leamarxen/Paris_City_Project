==== Vasserot duplicate streets ==== 

In the "Vasserot" dataset streets are often named more than once.  This is
because the authors of the dataset treated segments of the same street as a
unique entity and because in Paris some streetnames were not unique during
that time. For our analysis we needed to differentiate between those two cases
and combine the geolocated data of all street segments. 

To combine street segments we used the shapely package to see if streets with
the same name are overlapping or are closer than a given distance. In the end
we decided on a distance of 200meters, after checking the results manually.

With this approach we could reduce the number of duplicate streetnames from
729 to 88. We excluded those duplicate streets from further analysis.
