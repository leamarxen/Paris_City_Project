# Outcome of the Tag Creation

This folder will store the files that contain the dataset enriched with tags. The CSV file will contain the tags for each entry in the dataset of Paris addresses in a column as a list. While the information about the RICHELIEU district is stored in a JSON file with the Street name as the first-level key, the number in the street as the second-level key, and the people are stored in a list per year.
