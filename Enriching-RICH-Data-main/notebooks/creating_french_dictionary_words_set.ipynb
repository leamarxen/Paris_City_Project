    "# Creating a list of French Words\n",

    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "To determine which set of words in the profession string are already having correct spelling and does not require any cleaning a set of correct words is used. Three external data sources are used to create this set of words. The set of words is created in the `cleaning_and_creating_tags.ipynb` notebook. However, in the `creating_french_dictionary_words_set.ipynb` notebook, two of the three external sources are preprocessed and stored as a JSON as pre-processing these files is time-consuming. The notebook reads the two sources of data and stores the words in a JSON file where the keys are the root forms of the words (lemma) and the values are a list of derived words from each lemma (flexions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a lexicon of the French language, a set of words is provided by ortolang as [Morphalou3](https://repository.ortolang.fr/api/content/morphalou/2/LISEZ_MOI.html#idp37913792) that has 159,271 lemmas and 954,690 inflected forms of modern French is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "For proper nouns, the proper nouns dictionary is sourced from [prolex-unitex](https://tln.lifat.univ-tours.fr/version-francaise/ressources/prolex-unitex). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the following files are read\n",
    "- the CSV file provided by Morphalou3 in [Morphalou3_formatCSV_toutEnUn](https://repository.ortolang.fr/api/content/morphalou/2/), whose format is described [here](https://repository.ortolang.fr/api/content/morphalou/2/LISEZ_MOI.html#idp37944688) and\n",
    "- the [DIC file](https://tln.lifat.univ-tours.fr/medias/fichier/prolex-unitex-1-2_1562935068094-zip?ID_FICHE=321994&INLINE=FALSE) provided by Prolex-Unitex in which each row has the word and its details in a single word (such as the context it is used and whether is masculine/feminine and singular or plural) separated by a comma.\n",
