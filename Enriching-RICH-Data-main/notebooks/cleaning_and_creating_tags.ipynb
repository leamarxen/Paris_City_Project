    "# Tags for Profession\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the code and commentary on the steps involved in the creation of tags for the professions of people in Paris.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is explained in detail at <ADD THE URL TO THE DOCUMENT>. In brief, the data generated from the [first phase of the project](https://quartier-richelieu.fr/) provided a dataset of entries from the trade directories of Paris. For each year a list of names, professions, and address sets was created. The address for the entries belonging to the Richelieu Quartier was cleaned and geo-referenced. However, the profession was not cleaned and normalized across years and the abbreviations were not filled. In the notebook, the profession for each entry of the dataset is cleaned by providing tags that represent the profession and filling the abbreviations with full forms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before this notebook, \n",
    "\n",
    "The `cleaning_special_characters.ipynb` notebook was run to generate `all_paris_jobs_splchar_cleaned.csv` file (the content is explained in [Reading the Data after cleaning for special characters](reading-the-data-after-cleaning-for-special-characters) section. This file will serve as the starting point of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the french language dictionaries provided by `Morphalou3` and `Prolex-Unitex` were used to create a set of unique words to serve as a list of correctly spelled words (the street names are added to the list in this notebook) for this project and saved as `words_from_french_language_dictionaries.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs the following keys tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During the OCR process, sometimes a single word is mistakenly broken into multiple words. So, an attempt is made to combine them.\n",
    "2. As the profession strings contain keywords and connecting words, the connecting words are removed and keywords are stored with cleaning at apostrophe and dot as tokens.\n",
    "3. The tokens that are not in the list of correct words are tried to merge with those in the list of correct words based on the token co-occurrence, frequency, and similarity.\n",
    "4. After merging, the tokens containing a dot are identified as potential abbreviations and they are filled based on co-occurrence, frequency, and similarity.\n",
    "5. After completing the abbreviations, the tokens are called tags, and the data is stored on the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is built on the following two major assumptions,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most of the words have a correct spelling\n",
    "2. The correct spelling appears more frequently than the misspelled one.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Similarity of words (tokens)\n",
    " \n",
    "The token similarity is the Levenshtein similarity between the tokens. The [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between two strings is the \"minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other\". The distance is normalized between 0 and 1 and converted into similarity. For this project, the similarity is calculated using the [RapidFuzz](https://github.com/maxbachmann/RapidFuzz) library's `fuzz.ratio` function without any processing of the strings. The reason for choosing this library is that the function to calculate the similarity between strings accepts a threshold for similarity and use it is as an early stopping criterion in calculating the similarity between the stings (based on the lengths of the strings, It is not possible to obtain a high similarity between the strings when the length of them is significantly different). It returns zero as the similarity when the similarity is less than the given threshold.    \n",

    "## Splitting a string into a set of words\n",
    "\n",
    "As the aim of the project is to create one-word tags, the strings with more than one word should be split into single words. The words are split at space, hyphen, apostrophe, and dot. After splitting the stings, the words that have less than the specified number of alphanumeric characters are removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "While space is an apparent choice, the reason for choosing the other delimiters are\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyphen: Generally, the hyphens are used to indicate a link between words or the end of the line, and the em dashes are used to provide an emphasis. However, the observation of the dataset has revealed that their usage is not consistent i.e. the hyphen and the em dash were used interchangeably by the OCR process. To standardize the process, the words are split at the hyphen.\n",
    "- Apostrophe: The apostrophe is mostly used when combining the complementary pronoun and a word starting with a vowel. Thus the word is split at apostrophe and only the keyword is retained.\n",
    "- Dot: In the dataset, a dot was mostly used to write abbreviations. Nevertheless, a word with a dot at the end and the next word in a string are combined. Thus, an attempt is made to split the words around the dot and check to disambiguate them into multiple probable words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "- a.p. moller-maersk to [a.p., moller, maersk]\n",
    "- Aire-sur-l'Adourto to [aire, sur, l’adour] and [aire, sur, adour] (as _l_ is an complementary pronoun)\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of splitting a string designed for this project is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The string is split in space and hyphen.\n",
    "2. For each substring after split\n",
    "    1. retain the substring if it is not present in the French stop words (obtained from nltk - corpus - stopwords) and has a minimum length after removing the non-alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "    2. If there is an apostrophe in the substring, split the sub-string at the apostrophe. Splitting at apostrophe involves,\n",
    "        1. If the left part of the substring (i.e. the character before the apostrophe) is in complementary pronouns then the only right part of the substring will be a possible substring to return.\n",
    "        2. If the left part of the substring (i.e. the word before the apostrophe) has more than one character and the last character of the first part is in the complementary pronouns then the first part without the last character and the second part as it is will be considered as the possible substrings to return if both the parts are in the list of correctly spelled words.\n",
    "        3. If there is no complementary pronoun before the apostrophe and then the string itself will be possible substrings to return. \n",
    "    3. If any of the substrings in the possible substrings to return contains a dot, then the substrings are split at a dot\n",
    "        1. If the part of the substring after a dot is a stop word, then the substring in the possible sub\\strings to return is updated by removing the characters after the dot.\n",
    "        2. If both the parts of the substring belong to a dictionary then the substring is split into sub substrings without the dot and the original substring in possible tokens to return is replaced by two substrings.\n",
    "    4.  At last, all the possible substrings that are valid are returned.\n",
    "        - A string (word) is said to be valid if it does not belong to a set of stop words and has at least the specified number of alpha numeric characters.\n",

    "4. `split_metier_strings_to_tokens`: Splits and returns the input strings at space, hyphens, apostrophe after removing stop words.\n",
    "5. `clean_tokens`: Splits the tokens (generated from splitting at space and hyphen) containing an apostrophe and dot to singular tokens if they contain complementary pronouns. Further, splits these tokens at the dot (if they contain any) and validates all of them.\n",
    "6. `apos_split`: The function accepts a string with an apostrophe and splits the string at the apostrophe.\n",
    "7. `complementary_pronouns_check`: Returns the string after the apostrophe, if the character before the apostrophe is a complementary pronoun, else returns None.\n",

    "\n",
    "The list of correctly spelled words plays a key role in the process of creating tags as described in the algorithm. In this section, three sources are used to create a set of words that are assumed to have correct spellings. As these sources not only contain a word, the strings are split at space, hyphen. The apostrophe and the complementary pronoun before the apostrophe are also removed, as the same pre-processing step will also be applied to the professions. Two types of datasets are used to create the list of correctly spelled words. The first type is the language dictionaries obtained from `Morphalou3` (for various French words) and `Prolex-Unitex` (for proper nouns in French). The second one is for the list of street names of Paris obtained from `Open Data Paris`.\n",

    "- Using the dictionaries provided by `Morphalou3` and `Prolex-Unitex` a list of words was created and saved as `words_from_french_language_dictionaries.json`. The keys in the JSON files are root forms of the words (the meaning of root forms is very loosely used here) and the values are a list of words that are derived from the root form. The script used to create the JSON file can be found at `creating_french_dictionary_words_set.ipynb`.\n",
    "- For the names of the streets, the table of streets of Paris is obtained from [Street names table](https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/denominations-emprises-voies-actuelles/table/?disjunctive.siecle&disjunctive.statut&disjunctive.typvoie&disjunctive.arrdt&disjunctive.quartier&disjunctive.feuille&sort=typo_min). The `denominations-emprises-voies-actuelles.csv` file contains details of the streets of Paris in 28 columns. The `Dénomination complète minuscule` columns are read and the strings are split and added to the list of correctly spelled words.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the third step, the tokens that do not have a correct spelling (identified through the list of correct words) will be merged with the closest correctly spelled word iteratively till there are no more possible merges. The merge is performed in three rounds. In the first two rounds, the context of the tokens (with respect to other tokens) is considered, and in the last round, the spellings are merged ignoring the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm for merging tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the first round, the tokens are merged according to the [Algorithm for contextual merging](#algorithm-for-contextual-merging).\n",
    "- In the second round in each per profession token set (after round 1) the less frequent tokens are removed. A number defined apriori will be used to determine if a token is frequent or not and the same process as round 1 is repeated.\n",
    "- In the third round, the low frequent tokens per token set are added back to the per profession token sets (after round 2), however, this time the tokens are considered individually i.e. all tokens sets will be of length 1 and the same process as round 1 is repeated.\n",
    "- After round 3, the per profession token sets (after round 2) are updated to change the tokens that are merged and the dataset is saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm for contextual merging\n",
    "\n",
    "1. While the tokens can be merged, continue the iteration\n",
    "2. Create a counter for each unique token present in the dataset at this step\n",
    "3. Group the per profession token sets (the result of step 2) based on the length of the sets.\n",
    "4. For each length of the token set\n",
    "    1. For each token set of the considered token set length\n",
    "        1. Compare with all other token sets of the same length, if the two token sets differ only by one token (i.e. all the tokens are the same except one) and if the tokens are mergeable (cf [Algorithm for checking tokens mergability](#algorithm-for-checking-tokens-mergability))\n",
    "            1. With the same tokens in both the token sets as a base, store all such pairs of mergeable tokens as values (Intuitively this means that the pairs of tokens are probably the same and they can be merged with confidence).\n",
    "                1. For the tokens of length one, there is no specific base and a dummy string is considered as the base and the merge is continued.\n",
    "5. For each base of token sets, produce a base-wise update mapping that stores the token and the token to which it should be updated (cf [Algorithm for merging token pairs](#algorithm-for-merging-token-pairs)).\n",
    "6. Combine the base-wise update mapping's produced per base of token sets to generate a token update mapping for the iteration.\n",
    "    1. This step is performed to combine the updates of tokens from the same token set that were merged under different bases.\n",
    "7. Using the token update mapping for the iteration, update the profession string to token sets mapping.\n",
    "8. If the profession string to token sets mapping is unchanged from the previous iteration (i.e. if no token is updated in the iteration) then stop the merging, else continue the merging from _2_.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Algorithm for checking tokens mergeability\n",
    "\n",
    "Two tokens can be mergeable if the tokens have a similarity greater than a certain threshold (defined apriori) and\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the high frequent token is in the list of correctly spelled words and the low frequent token is not in the list of correctly spelled words.\n",
    "2. If both the tokens have the same frequency and only one of them is in the list of correctly spelled words\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the token that is not in the list of correctly spelled words is merged to the word that is in the list of correctly spelled words.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Token similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "The token similarity is the Levenshtein similarity between the tokens. The [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between two strings is the \"minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other\". The distance is normalized between 0 and 1 and converted into similarity. For this project, the similarity is calculated using the [RapidFuzz](https://github.com/maxbachmann/RapidFuzz) library's `fuzz.ratio` function without any processing of the strings. The reason for choosing this library is that the function to calculate the similarity between strings accepts a threshold for similarity and use it is as an early stopping criterion in calculating the similarity between the stings (based on the lengths of the strings, It is not possible to obtain a high similarity between the strings when the length of them is significantly different). It returns zero as the similarity when the similarity is less than the given threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Algorithm for merging token pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given base and the pairs of tokens that are mergeable, a two-step process is followed to determine to which token the pairs are changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loop over all the pairs to create a mapping with key as the token and value as a list of tuples containing that token that it can be merged with and the similarity between the two tokens.\n",
    "2. For each of the tokens to be merged,\n",
    "    1. If there is only one token that it can be merged with then the token to be merged is changed to the token it can be merged with.\n",
    "    2. else if there are more than one possible tuples, then the token to be merged is changed to the token with the highest similarity score.\n",
    "        1. If there are multiple tokens with the same similarity score, then the token to be merged is changed to the token that has appeared more frequently among those that have the same frequency.\n",
    "    3. If the token is not yet merged, then the token is left as it is without merging.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Utility functions to merge misspelled tokens with the correctly spelled tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `merge_close_spellings`: The function accepts the list of tokens sets for all the dataset along with a set of correctly spelled words, the thresholds to check if tokens can be classified as low frequency and if two tokens are similar and return the updated list of token sets for all the dataset and an array with the similarity scores of tokens that are merged.\n",
    "2. `get_similar_tokens_differed_by_one_token`: The function accepts the clustering of token sets based on their length at current iteration, along with the clustering at previous iteration (to help in early stopping), the frequency counter for the tokens in the dataset, list of correctly spelled words and a minimum similarity score for the tokens to be able declared similar and return a mapping(Python dictionary). The returned python dictionary has the set of tokens common between two token sets (except one token) and the value is another dictionary. The key for the secondary dictionary is the pair of tokens that share the tokens in the primary dictionary that are mergeable and different only by these two tokens with the value as another dictionary. In the tertiary and last dictionary, there are two elements, the `sim_score` key has the similarity score between the secondary token pair as the value and the `merge_to` key has one of the tokens in the secondary dictionary key pair that will absorb the other token.\n",
    "3. `are_tokens_mergable`: The function accepts two tokens, along with their frequency, presence in the list of correctly spelled words, and a threshold of similarity score and returns the similarity score and the token that will absorb the other token. The algorithm to decide if two tokens are mergeable is described as `Algorithm for checking tokens mergeability's in the documentation above.\n",
    "4. `group_connected_words_with_common_base`: The function accepts the dictionary of common tokens and the mergeable tokens for the base along with their counter and their presence in the list of correctly spelled words and returns the mapping of the updates to the tokens per tokens set of profession strings.\n",
    "5. `get_replacements`: This function accepts the similar tokens for having common tokens along with their similarity and returns one, a dictionary with the key as the token and the value as the token to replace the key, and two, a set of tokens updated in the current iteration.\n",
    "6. `get_tok_count`: The function accepts the profession token sets for all the entries of a dataset and returns a counter containing the frequency for each token.\n",
    "7. `get_unique_token_sets`: Return the unique profession token sets present in the dataset\n",
    "8. `get_length_wise_token_sets`: The function accepts the unique token sets of the dataset and clusters them based on the length of the token sets.\n",
    "9. `print_token_statistics`: The function prints the statistics about the changes in the number of tokens after the iteration or round.\n",
    "10. `print_merge_statistics`: The function prints the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of the similarity scores.\n",
    "11. `get_current_token_sets`: Get the last token set for a list of list of token sets."

In the tertiary and last dictionary there are two elements, the ``sim_score`` key has the similarity score between the secondary token pair as the value and ``merge_to`` key has the one of the token in the secondary dictionary key pair that will absorb the other token.\n",

    "## Completing the Abbreviations with the full word (Step 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous step, the tokens that do not have a correct spelling were merged with the closest correctly spelled word iteratively. In this last algorithmic step, the tokens that are classified as abbreviations are completed into full words. Any token containing a dot (`.`) is classified as an abbreviation. The idea of completing the abbreviations is drawn from round 1 of the previous step i.e. to use the contextual tokens to decide the abbreviations of the words. After the abbreviations are filled with contextual information, for the second time, the remaining ones are filled based on only frequency and similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm for completing the abbreviations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The current token sets for all the entries in the dataset are considered.\n",
    "2. The abbreviations are completed using the contextual tokens (see [Algorithm for completing the abbreviations with support](#algorithm-for-completing-the-abbreviations-with-support))\n",
    "3. Collected the tokens that have a dot as potential abbreviations after _2_.\n",
    "4. The abbreviations are completed without contextual tokens (see [Algorithm for completing the abbreviations without support](#algorithm-for-completing-the-abbreviations-without-support))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm for completing the abbreviations with support\n",
    "\n",
    "1. While the abbreviations can be filled, continue the iteration for the current list of token sets per profession (The token sets with only one token are ignored in this sub-step as they do not have contextual information)\n",
    "2. Get the co-occurance frequency using the complete dataset with all possible combination of tokens for a given token set i.e. for a set of 3 tokens T1, T2 and T3, the possible combinations are `{T1, T2}, {T2, T3}, {T1, T3}, {{T1, T2}, T3}, {{T1, T3}, T2} and {{T2, T3}, {T1}}`.\n",
    "3. The unique token sets are clustered based on the length. \n",
    "4. For each length of the token set\n",
    "    1. For each token set of the considered token set length\n",
    "        1. If not all the tokens are in the list of correctly spelled words and there is any token with a dot\n",
    "            1. Compare with all other token sets of the same length that have at least one token in the list of correctly spelled words\n",
    "                1. If the two token sets differ only by one token (i.e. all the tokens are the same except one), only one token has a dot (abbreviation) and the other token is in the list of correctly spelled words (full form), the length the full form is greater than the abbreviation and lastly the 2-gram Jaccard similarity of the abbreviation without a dot and the full form (reduced to the length of the abbreviation without dot) (called modified Jaccard score) is greater than the set threshold\n",
    "                    1. With the same tokens in both the token sets as a base, store all such pairs of abbreviation and full form tokens along with the modified Jaccard score and the frequency of the full form with the common tokens.\n",
    "5. For each base of token sets,\n",
    "    1. For each abbreviation and its possible full forms, select the full form with the highest modified Jaccard score and then the frequency of the full form with the common tokens to produce a base wise update mapping that stores the token and the token to which it should be updated.\n",
    "6. Using the base-wise abbreviation full forms the tokens sets containing those abbreviations are updated. While updating the abbreviations, a counter indicating the number of times an abbreviation is replaced for a particular full form is created. To keep in mind, this counter is created over unique token sets rather than the full dataset.     \n",
    "7. If there aren't anymore full form suggestions from _5_ then stop the iteration, else continue from _2_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm for completing the abbreviations without support\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each possible abbreviation\n",
    "    1. If the same abbreviation is filled while using the support, then the full form that the abbreviation is replaced with for the most number of times using the support is used to complete the unfilled abbreviation.\n",
    "    2. If the abbreviation is not filled while using the support, then the closest abbreviation that was filled using the support is obtained by using the `fuzz.ratio` similarity. If the multiple filled abbreviations have the same similarity as the unfilled one, the filled abbreviation with high frequency is considered and the unfilled abbreviation is filled with the full form that the filled abbreviation is replaced with for the most number of times using the support.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utility functions to fill the abbreviations \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `get_cooccurring_frequency`: Returns the co-occurrence frequency using the current list of token sets with all possible combinations of tokens for a given token set.\n",
    "2. `get_possible_full_form`: The function accepts the token sets grouped length-wise along with a set of correctly spelled words, the tokens cooccurring frequency, and a threshold score for similarity of full form and abbreviation and return a dictionary with the common tokens as keys and the abbreviation and potential full forms as values.\n",
    "3. `get_full_form_suggestions_per_unique_tokens_set`: The function accepts a list of possible full for a given abbreviation with a set of common tokens between the abbreviation and the full form and selects the full form that is similar and most frequent.\n",
    "4. `fill_abbreviations_with_support`: The function accepts the current token sets for the full dataset and iteratively fills the abbreviations with support until no more abbreviations can be filled.\n",
    "5. `fill_abbreviations_without_support`: The function accepts the unique tokens left after filling abbreviations using contextual tokens and other related arguments and returns a mapping of unfilled abbreviations to a full form and the counter of abbreviation and full form \n",
    "6. `fill_abbreviations_with_full_forms`: The function accepts the list of token sets after round 3 of step 3 along with the list of correctly spelled words, the similarity thresholds and return the list of lists of tokens sets after completing full forms for an abbreviation with and without the support and the counter for abbreviation and full form pair."
